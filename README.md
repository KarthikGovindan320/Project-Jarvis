# Project-Jarvis

## Overview
**Project-Jarvis** is my biggest and most ambitious project yet â€” the result of a year-long journey.  
Inspired by the beloved AI assistant *JARVIS* from the Iron Man movies, this project is my attempt to bring that concept to life.

Although the project began before voice-powered AI assistants became common in app stores, by the time it was completed, many similar tools existed.  
However, the skills I gained and the passion that kept me going make this project truly worth it.

## Features
My version of JARVIS is a highly intelligent AI voice assistant powered by **Google's Gemini-Pro model**.  
But it's more than just a voice assistant â€” it's a multipurpose digital companion with powerful capabilities:

### Voice & Gesture-Based Control
- Fully control your **computer without a keyboard or mouse**, using only hand gestures (via OpenCV).
- Control **smart appliances** (e.g., lights, fans) via hand gestures, assuming they're connected to smart switches.

### Communication & Utilities
- Set alarms and reminders.
- Send emails and WhatsApp messages.
- Generate AI images based on voice prompts and email them.
- Send **SOS alerts** to predefined emergency contacts.

### Smart Assistance
- Perform voice-based web searches.
- Play YouTube videos by voice command.
- Use conversational AI for general tasks, queries, and help.

## Requirements
- API keys for Gemini-Pro and other integrated services.
- Smart appliances must be connected via compatible smart switches for remote control.
- A webcam for gesture control via OpenCV.

> ðŸ’¸ **Monthly Cost**:  
The average monthly cost to run JARVIS is around **â‚¹50**, depending on API usage.  
A **free version** is in the works â€” stay tuned!

## Notes
- Built with Python, OpenCV, and various third-party APIs.
- Regular updates planned to enhance functionality and usability.

## Feedback
I'm **excited to receive feedback, suggestions, or feature requests**.  
Whether youâ€™re an AI enthusiast or just curious, I hope this project inspires you as much as it inspired me to build it.
